## Objective: Implement a UART transmitter that sends data based on sensor inputs, enabling the FPGA to communicate real-time sensor data to an external device.

â€¢  Steps:
1.	Study the Existing Code:
o	Access the uart_tx_sense project from the VSDSquadron_FM repository.
o	Review the Verilog code to understand how sensor data is acquired and transmitted.
2.	Design Documentation:
o	Create a block diagram depicting the integration of the sensor module with the UART transmitter.
o	Develop a circuit diagram showing connections between the FPGA, sensor, and the receiving device.
3.	Implementation:
o	Set up the hardware according to the circuit diagram, ensuring proper sensor interfacing.
o	Synthesize and load the Verilog code onto the FPGA.
4.	Testing and Verification:
o	Stimulate the sensor and observe the transmitted data on a serial terminal to verify accurate sensor data transmission.
5.	Documentation:
o	Assemble the block diagram, circuit diagram, code analysis, and testing results into a detailed report.
o	Record a short video demonstrating the system transmitting sensor data via UART.
