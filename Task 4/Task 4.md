# **Objective:**
Implement a UART transmitter that sends data based on sensor inputs, enabling the FPGA to communicate real-time sensor data to an external device.

## 1.	Study the Existing Code:
-	Access the uart_tx_sense project from the VSDSquadron_FM repository.
-	Review the Verilog code to understand how sensor data is acquired and transmitted.

## 2.	Design Documentation:
-	Create a block diagram depicting the integration of the sensor module with the UART transmitter.
-	Develop a circuit diagram showing connections between the FPGA, sensor, and the receiving device.

## 3.	Implementation:
-	Set up the hardware according to the circuit diagram, ensuring proper sensor interfacing.
-	Synthesize and load the Verilog code onto the FPGA.

## 4.	Testing and Verification:
-	Stimulate the sensor and observe the transmitted data on a serial terminal to verify accurate sensor data transmission.

# 5.	Documentation:
-	Assemble the block diagram, circuit diagram, code analysis, and testing results into a detailed report.
-	Record a short video demonstrating the system transmitting sensor data via UART.
