# Project Themes:
•  Real-Time Sensor Data Acquisition and Transmission System: This theme focuses on developing systems that interface with various sensors to collect data, process it using the FPGA, and transmit the information to external devices through communication protocols like UART.
•  FPGA-Based Digital Oscilloscope: This theme involves designing a digital oscilloscope utilizing the FPGA to sample input signals, process the data, and display waveforms on a screen, enabling real-time signal analysis.
 
## Objectives:
•	Conduct comprehensive research on the chosen theme.
•	Formulate a detailed project proposal outlining the system's functionality, required components, and implementation strategy.
Steps:
### 1.	Literature Review:
-	Explore existing projects and resources related to the selected theme. 
### 2.	Define System Requirements:
-	Identify the necessary hardware components, such as specific sensors or display modules, and software tools required for the project.
### 3.	Design System Architecture:
-	Develop block diagrams illustrating the system's architecture, including data flow between components.
### 4.	Develop a Project Plan:
-	Outline the implementation steps, timelines, and milestones for the project with detailed explanation and block diagrams wherever necessary
Deliverables:
-	A comprehensive project proposal document.
-	System architecture diagrams.
-	A detailed project plan with timelines.
