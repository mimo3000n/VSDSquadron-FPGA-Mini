# Objectives:
-	Execute the project plan by developing, testing, and validating the system.
-	Document the entire process comprehensively and create a short video demonstrating the project's functionality.

## 1.	Develop FPGA Modules:
 - 	Write Verilog or VHDL code for each module, such as sensor interfaces, data processing units, and UART communication blocks.
 - 	
## 2.	Simulate and Test Modules:

o	Utilize simulation tools to verify the functionality of each module before hardware implementation.

## 3.	Integrate and Test Hardware:
o	Assemble the hardware components based on the circuit diagrams.
o	Program the FPGA with the developed code.
o	Conduct thorough testing to ensure the system operates as intended.

## 4.	Document the Project:
o	Compile comprehensive documentation, including system overview, design schematics, annotated code listings, and testing procedures.
o	Create a short video demonstrating the project's functionality.
## 5.	Publish on GitHub:
o	Use the same GitHub repository for the project.
o	Upload all project files, including code, documentation, and the demonstration video.

### pulsview (open souce sw for tiny logic analysator from sigrock) testing:

- D1 is trigger line
- D2 is Echo line of ultrasonic sensor show puls wide is dependent from object distance, simulated with hand movement.
