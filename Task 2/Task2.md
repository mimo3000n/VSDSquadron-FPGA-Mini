Objective: Implement a UART loopback mechanism where transmitted data is immediately received back, facilitating testing of UART functionality.
Fill up the form - https://forms.gle/yDWvJhwDYzmxG4bc7 
â€¢  Steps:
# 1.	Study the Existing Code:
  -	Access the uart_loopback project from the VSDSquadron_FM repository.
  -	Analyze the Verilog code to understand the loopback logic.

# 2.	Design Documentation:
  -	Create a block diagram illustrating the UART loopback architecture.
  -	Develop a detailed circuit diagram showing connections between the FPGA and any peripheral devices used.

# 3.	Implementation:
  -	Set up the hardware as per the circuit diagram.
  -	Synthesize and upload the Verilog code to the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini.

# 4.	Testing and Verification:
  -	Use a serial terminal to send data to the FPGA and verify that the same data is received back, confirming successful loopback.

# 5.	Documentation:
  -	Compile the block diagram, circuit diagram, code explanations, and testing results into a comprehensive report.
  -	Record a short video demonstrating the loopback functionality in action.
