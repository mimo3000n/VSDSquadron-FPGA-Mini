## Step 1: Understanding the Verilog Code
```verilog
module top (
  // outputs
  output wire led_red  , // Red
  output wire led_blue , // Blue
  output wire led_green , // Green
  input wire hw_clk,  // Hardware Oscillator, not the internal oscillator
  output wire testwire
);

  wire        int_osc            ;
  reg  [27:0] frequency_counter_i;

  assign testwire = frequency_counter_i[5];
 
  always @(posedge int_osc) begin

The ICE40 family of FPGAs from Lattice Semiconductor includes several internal oscillators that can be utilized in various designs. Here's a detailed overview of the internal oscillators available in ICE40 FPGAs:

##### Internal Oscillators in ICE40 Analysis
<details>
  <summary> Types of internal oscillators in IEC40 family</summary>
##### Overview
The ICE40 FPGA family includes dedicated high-frequency oscillators (HFOs) that allow for the generation of internal clock signals that can be used to drive various components within the FPGA. These internal oscillators provide a convenient and resource-efficient way to create clock signals without the need for external components.

#### Parameterization
- **Configuration Options**: Each oscillator can be configured with parameters that determine its frequency and behavior. Users can choose the division factor for the output frequency according to application requirements.

##### High-Frequency (HF) Oscillator Parameters
The HF oscillator in the ICE40 FPGA has the following key parameters:

1. **CLKHF_DIV**:
   - **Description**: Determines the division factor for the output clock frequency.
   - **Options**:
     - `0b00`: Output frequency equals the internal clock frequency (no division).
     - `0b01`: Output frequency equals the internal clock frequency divided by 2.
     - `0b10`: Output frequency equals the internal clock frequency divided by 4.
     - `0b11`: Output frequency equals the internal clock frequency divided by 8.

2. **CLKHFPU**:

what is used in Task 1 Verliog code:

- **int_osc** : it is designed to carry the output from the internal oscillator **SB_HFOSC** used in the design
```verilog
            wire        int_osc;
```
- **frequency_counter_i** : 28bit register as frequency counter used for timing information and testing/debugging
```verilog
            reg  [27:0] frequency_counter_i;
```
          frequency_counter_i is incremented on every positive edge of *int_osc*
```verilog
            always @(posedge int_osc) begin
                frequency_counter_i <= frequency_counter_i + 1'b1;
            end
```
- **instantiation of internal oscilliator (*SB_HFOSC*)**

##### Internal LED Driver in ICE40
<details>
<summary> description of internal LED Driver in IEC40 family</summary>
In the ICE40 FPGA family from Lattice Semiconductor, there is an internal RGB LED driver that can be used to control RGB LEDs directly from the FPGA fabric. This allows you to easily interface with RGB LEDs without requiring external components. Here are some details about the internal LED driver:

###### Internal RGB LED Driver
Module Name: SB_RGBA_DRV

This module is used to drive RGB LEDs, which generally support Red, Green, and Blue color channels.
Key Features:

The driver allows for the control of multiple LED components simultaneously, facilitating RGB color mixing.
It supports pulse-width modulation (PWM) to control the brightness of each channel by varying the duty cycle.
Inputs and Outputs:

###### Inputs:
RGBLEDEN: Enables the LED driver. Setting this to high allows the RGB LEDs to be driven.
RGB0PWM, RGB1PWM, RGB2PWM: These signals control the brightness levels of the Red, Green, and Blue components, respectively. They are usually set to represent PWM values.
CURREN: This signal is used to enable the current drivers for the respective RGB channels.
####### Outputs:
RGB0, RGB1, RGB2: These are the output signals connected to the actual RGB LED cathodes (or anodes, depending on the LED configuration).
###### Configuration
Brightness Control: The PWM signals typically would be generated by counters or other logic in your design to control how bright each color is displayed on the RGB LED.
Current Settings: The RGB driver allows you to set the driving current for each channel using defparam statements to match the LED specifications for optimal brightness.
###### Documentation Reference
To get more in-depth information regarding the RGB LED driver:

ICE40 Family Data Sheet: Look for details about the RGB driver and its functionality.
ICE40 UltraPlus FPGA User Guide: It includes examples and additional details about using the internal LED driver.
###### Summary
The ICE40 FPGA family includes an internal RGB LED driver (SB_RGBA_DRV) that simplifies controlling RGB LEDs directly from the FPGA, allowing for flexible control over color and brightness. This is particularly useful for user interfaces and visual signaling in various applications. 
</details>

- **instantiation of RGB LED Driver (*SB_RGBA_DRV*)**
```verilog
 SB_RGBA_DRV RGB_DRIVER (
    .RGBLEDEN(1'b1                                            ),
    .RGB0PWM (1'b0), // red
    .RGB1PWM (1'b0), // green
    .RGB2PWM (1'b1), // blue
    .CURREN  (1'b1                                            ),
    .RGB0    (led_red                                       ), //Actual Hardware connection
    .RGB1    (led_green                                       ),
    .RGB2    (led_blue                                        )
  );
  defparam RGB_DRIVER.RGB0_CURRENT = "0b000001";
  defparam RGB_DRIVER.RGB1_CURRENT = "0b000001";
  defparam RGB_DRIVER.RGB2_CURRENT = "0b000001";
```

- Configuration:
    1. *RGBLEDEN = 1'b1* : Enables LED operation
    2. *RGB0PWM = 1'b0* : Red LED minimum brightness
    3. *RGB1PWM = 1'b0* : Green LED minimum brightness
    4. *RGB2PWM = 1'b1* : Blue LED maximum brightness
    5. *CURREN = 1'b1* : Enables current control
- Current settings: All LEDs set to "0b000001" (minimum current)
- Output connections:
    1. *RGB0* → *led_red*
    2. *RGB1* → *led_green*
    3. *RGB2* → *led_blue*
  
## Step 2: Creating the PCF File

The PCF [Physical Constraint File] file can be accessed [here](https://github.com/mimo3000n/VSDSquadron-FPGA-Mini/blob/a8364ed4a33e27c54fb73841acb0c101f5b01b22/Task%201/VSDSquadronFM.pcf). It is used in FPGA development to map logical signals from HDL code to physical pins on the FPGA chip. Each set_io command establishes this connection between the named ports to physical pins on the board.
```pcf
set_io  led_red	39
set_io  led_blue 40
set_io  led_green 41
set_io  hw_clk 20
set_io  testwire 17
````

**set_io**

- This command is used to assign specific I/O signals (wires) in your HDL design to physical pins on the FPGA package. It tells the synthesis and implementation tools which FPGA pins correspond to the specified logic signals in your design.

**led_red, led_blue, led_green, hw_clk, testwire**

-These are the names of the logical signals (or wires) defined in your Verilog design. Each name corresponds to a specific output or input in your design that connects to physical hardware components, such as LEDs or clocks.


**39, 40, 41, 20, 17**
- These are the physical pin numbers of the FPGA where each respective signal will be connected. The numbers refer to the physical pin assignments on the FPGA package.

| Signal    | FPGA Pin | Description          |
|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| led_red   | 39      | Red LED Output       |
| led_blue  | 40      | Blue LED Output      |
| led_green | 41      | Green LED Output     |
| hw_clk    | 20      | External Clock Input |
| testwire  | 17      | Debugging Signal     |
