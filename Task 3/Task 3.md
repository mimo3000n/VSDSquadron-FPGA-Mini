# Objective: Develop a UART transmitter module capable of sending serial data from the FPGA to an external device.

## 1.	Study the Existing Code:
-	Access the uart_tx project from the VSDSquadron_FM repository.
-	Examine the Verilog code to understand the transmission process.
## 2.	Design Documentation:
-	Create a block diagram detailing the UART transmitter module.
-	Develop a circuit diagram illustrating the FPGA's UART TX pin connection to the receiving device.
## 3.	Implementation:
-	Assemble the hardware setup as depicted in the circuit diagram.
-	Synthesize and program the FPGA with the UART transmitter code.
## 4.	Testing and Verification:
-	Connect the FPGA to a PC or another UART-compatible device.
-	Use a serial terminal to observe the transmitted data, ensuring accurate data transmission.
## 5.	Documentation:
-	Document the block diagram, circuit diagram, code walkthrough, and testing outcomes.
-	Produce a short video showcasing the UART transmission in operation.
