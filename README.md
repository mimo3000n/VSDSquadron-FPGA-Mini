## ‚úÖ Task
- [Task 1](https://github.com/Arihaansingh/VSDSquadron_fpga_mini-FM-Internship_By-Arihaan_singh/blob/main/Task%201/Task%201%20.md) -The project focuses on implementing and testing an FPGA-based RGB LED controller on the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini board. It involves analyzing a Verilog design, mapping pin configurations using a PCF file, and programming the FPGA to control LED behavior using an internal oscillator.

- [Task 2](https://github.com/Arihaansingh/VSDSquadron_fpga_mini-FM-Internship_By-Arihaan_singh/blob/main/Task%202/Task%202.md) -The project implements a UART loopback mechanism on the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini, where transmitted data is immediately received back, enabling easy testing and debugging of UART functionality
