## ‚úÖ Task
- [Task 1](https://github.com/mimo3000n/VSDSquadron-FPGA-Mini/tree/f2dc22679ddc3caba393c163f38a492fbb7128da/Task%201) -The project focuses on implementing and testing an FPGA-based RGB LED controller on the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini board. It involves analyzing a Verilog design, mapping pin configurations using a PCF file, and programming the FPGA to control LED behavior using an internal oscillator.

- [Task 2](https://github.com/mimo3000n/VSDSquadron-FPGA-Mini/tree/f2dc22679ddc3caba393c163f38a492fbb7128da/Task%202) -The task implements a UART loopback mechanism on the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini, where transmitted data is immediately received back, enabling easy testing and debugging of UART functionality

- [Task 3](https://github.com/mimo3000n/VSDSquadron-FPGA-Mini/tree/f2dc22679ddc3caba393c163f38a492fbb7128da/Task%203) - This task develop a UART transmitter module capable of sending serial data from the FPGA to an external device.

- [Task 4](https://github.com/mimo3000n/VSDSquadron-FPGA-Mini/tree/f2dc22679ddc3caba393c163f38a492fbb7128da/Task%204) - This task implement a UART transmitter that sends data based on sensor inputs, enabling the FPGA to communicate real-time sensor data to an external device.
